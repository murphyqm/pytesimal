[//]: # (Background)

[//]: # (Meteorites provide insights into some of the earliest planetary bodies in the Solar System: planetesimals, the building blocks of the planets and the asteroid belt. Unlike geological samples collected from field locations, meteorite samples often lack geological context. Modelling the evolution of small bodies in the Solar System allows us to make estimates about the conditions under which the meteorite material formed and was processed, placing the samples in context and allowing us to better understand planet building processes in the early Solar System.)

[//]: # (Differentiated meteorites formed within bodies that melted and segregated to a certain extent, before slowly cooling. Some meteorite samples capture a cooling history attributed to this later conductive cooling stage of the parent body. One such group of meteorites, the pallasites, may have formed through a collision which caused molten metal to be injected into the olivine-rich mantle of a differentiated planetesimal [@Walte2020]. The cooling rate of this metal below 975 K following injection into the mantle is captured in Ni diffusion profiles in regions of Widmanst√§tten pattern [@Yang2010]. In conjunction with modelling, this cooling rate recorded at $\sim$800 K can be used to calculate the depth at which the pallasite material resided within its parent body. Paleomagnetic records in some samples indicate that a core dynamo was active when the regions of pallasite material cooled through the tetrataenite formation temperature [@Bryson2015; @Nichols2016]. )

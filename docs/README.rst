Features
========

-  Constant or variable material properties
-  Choose to return compressed ``.npz`` NumPy arrays of temperature and
   cooling rates through time and radius
-  Plot temperature or cooling rate heatmaps
-  Return timing of core solidification, and depth and timing of
   meteorite formation
-  Return a parameter ``.json`` file with details of input parameters
   and results

Installation
============

This software relies on python (version 3.6 and up) and various other
python packages. Examples are distributed as Jupyter notebooks, which
need Jupyter and Matplotlib to run. Installation and management of all
these dependencies is most easily done in a conda environment.

   Package not yet available for install on PyPi, instructions for pip
   install will be added once this is available.

Installation for development
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The package can be downloaded and installed directly from Github for the
most recent version. The software and its dependencies are best
installed in a virtual environment of your choice. Download of the
software and creation of an isolated conda environment can be done by
running:

::

   git clone https://github.com/murphyqm/pytesimal.git
   cd pytesimal
   conda create -n=pytesimal python=3.8 jupyter
   conda activate pytesimal
   pip install -e .

The ``-e`` flag installs the package in editable mode so that any
changes to modules can be carried through. Examples can be downloaded
from the gallery
`here <https://pytesimal.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/index.html>`__.

Quick Start
===========

.. image:: https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg
 :target: https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/murphyqm/pytesimal/master?filepath=example-notebooks

To run a case with parameters loaded from file:

::

   import pytesimal.load_plot_save
   import pytesimal.quick_workflow

Define a filepath and filename for the parameter file:

::

   folderpath = 'path/to/the/example/'
   filename = 'example_parameters'
   filepath = f'{folderpath}{filename}.txt'

Save a default parameters file to the filepath:

::

   pytesimal.load_plot_save.make_default_param_file(filepath)

You can open this ``json`` file in a text editor and change the default
values. Once youâ€™ve edited and saved it, use it as an input file for a
model run:

::

   pytesimal.quick_workflow.workflow(filename, folderpath)

Let your planetesimal evolve! This will take a minute or so to run. Once
it has done do, you can load the results (from the folder you specified
in the parameters file):

::

   filepath = 'results_folder/example_parameters_results.npz'
   (temperatures,
    coretemp,
    dT_by_dt,
    dT_by_dt_core) = pytesimal.load_plot_save.read_datafile(filepath)

Then you can plot heatmaps of the temperatures and cooling rates within
the planetesimal:

::

   # Specify a figure width and height:
   fig_w = 6
   fig_h = 9

   pytesimal.load_plot_save.two_in_one(
   fig_w,
   fig_h,
   temperatures,
   coretemp,
   dT_by_dt,
   dT_by_dt_core)

See the Jupyter notebooks hosted on Binder for live working examples, or
download the example scripts provided.

# planetesimal-cooling
Conductive cooling model of a differentiated planetesimal with temperature-dependent properties

## To do:
- [x] os makedir output runs
- [x] remove dependency on temp_timestepping.py
- [ ] print results in mya not timestep
- [ ] timing/efficiency - clean up code!
- [ ] reduce print outs of data while model is running
- [ ] radius step - fix hard coding issue
- [x] fontpath issues when plotting
- [ ] rename modules with more straightforward names
- [ ] write up useful readMe
- [ ] update variables that can be input

# planetesimal-cooling
Conductive cooling model of a differentiated planetesimal with temperature-dependent properties

## To do:
- [x] os makedir output runs
- [x] remove dependency on temp_timestepping.py
- [x] print results in mya not timestep
- [ ] reduce unlabelled/unhelpful print outs of data while model is running
- [ ] radius step - fix hard coding issue
- [x] fontpath issues when plotting
- [ ] rename modules with more straightforward names
- [ ] write up useful readMe
- [ ] update variables that can be input
- [ ] general linting of all files
   - [x] core_cooling.py
   - [ ] modular_cond_cooling.py
   - [ ] temp_timestepping.py

# To-Do

- Sort out plotting module - migrate and merge simple plotting module from module output data rep and combine
- Set up Jupyter Notebook example that runs model and plots result. Need to build plotting in so it can be called without saving arrays (current, messy version does this but need cleaner version to work too)
- Function naming and documentation - need to clean and make sure is useful and up to date
